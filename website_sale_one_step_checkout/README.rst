One Step Checkout combines all Odoo checkout steps into one and removes all unnecessary fields and
questions. Never before has check-out been easier and faster!

Improving the checkout process results in more customers completing their sales, and this has an immediate impact on your bottom line.
It is the single most effective technical change you can make to reduce shopping cart abandonment.

Known issues / Roadmap

* Check if the One Step Checkout works with website_event_register_free_with_sale.
* Checkout form should have HTML5 validation, but that should be in core or a
  separate module.
* ToDo Controllers: Overwrite /shop/extra_info
